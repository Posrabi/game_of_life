### Game of life simulator

---

# How to run

You need to have opencv4 installed, then run

```bash
make
```

That's it, all you need to do now is run 

```bash
./main
```

# TODO

- Increase the resolution of the simulator, currently it's doing a digital zoom on a 100 x 100 image.
- Try out more god functions
